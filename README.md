### 🔧 Getting Started

If you are interested in using this bot, you need to know a few things!

- The room with the BOT can be created from the following integration [Headless Host](https://github.com/haxball/haxball-issues/wiki/Headless-Host), just open a normal browser page at this link [Headless Host Site](https://html5.haxball.com/headless) and put the BOT code in the console of that page.

### 🖥️ Local machine - [Tutorial (SOON)](https://www.youtube.com)

1. Open the [Haxball Headless Page](https://www.haxball.com/headless)
2. Open devtools using F12 and select the console
3. Copy ALL your code from `haxbot.js` and paste in console
4. For the room to finish opening, complete the captcha
5. The room is now open, copy or enter the link that the page gives you (keep the HaxBall Headless tab open)

Remembering that you can use and abuse this bot as you want, I'm posting it here especially for people who want a template like this, or people who don't know how to program and want to create a room. So enjoy! 🥰

If you enjoy the bot, consider giving it a star to show your appreciation ❤️
