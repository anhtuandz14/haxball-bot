## ‚û§ How to become an administrator in the room

> To log in as admin, you need to use the command "!loginadm (password)"

### Edit the admin command in the code

Both the password and the admin command are editable, use ctrl + f in your code editor and search for `!loginadm`

```js
else if (["!loginadm"].includes(message[0].toLowerCase())) {
  if (message[1] == adminPassword) {
      room.setPlayerAdmin(player.id, true);
      var stats;
      localStorage.getItem(getAuth(player)) ? stats = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(getAuth(player))) : stats = [0, 0, 0, 0, "0.00", 0, 0, 0, 0, "0.00", "player", player.name];
      if (stats[Ss.RL] != "master") {
          stats[Ss.RL] = "master";
          room.sendAnnouncement(player.name + " logged in as Administrator!", null, 0xFF7900, 2);
          localStorage.setItem(getAuth(player), JSON.stringify(stats));
    }
  }
}
```

### Edit admin password

Use ctrl + f in your code editor and search for `adminPassword`

```js
var adminPassword = 4002;
```
